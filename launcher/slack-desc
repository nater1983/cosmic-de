# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

launcher: launcher (Modular IPC-based desktop launcher service)
launcher:
launcher: Modular IPC-based desktop launcher service, written in Rust. Desktop
launcher: launchers may interface with this service via spawning the
launcher: pop-launcher process and communicating to it via JSON IPC over the
launcher: stdin and stdout pipes. The launcher service will also spawn plugins
launcher: found in plugin directories on demand, based on the queries sent to
launcher: the service. Using IPC enables each plugin to isolate their data
launcher: from other plugin processes and frontends that are interacting with
launcher: them.
